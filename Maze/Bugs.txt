0.6_BFS_AStar_Merge:
1. Need to check Ghost Movement more thoroughly:
    a) Need to iterate for more than 1 ghost at one location.
    b) Need to check blocked cell traversal logic (before and after) more thoroughly. 
    b) Need to check if ghost moving conditions are totally right? Check comments marked with KV and 'Bug01'.
